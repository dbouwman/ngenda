Guard staff (both in the Joint Operations Center [JOC] and in the field) are enabled to enter information and track data on a map for Fragmentary Orders (FRAGO), Situational Reports (SITREP), and Significant Activities (SIGACT) through the viewer. The FRAGO widget allows staff to enter the five paragraph order information necessary for this report, place a FRAGO on the map at the appropriate location, and permit guard personnel who have access to see FRAGO data as icons on a map and recall the information tied to the FRAGOs. Furthermore, guard staff can tie mission tasks and associated details for multiple locations to the FRAGO and display these tasks on the map. The SITREP widget allows guard staff to enter information for the report and can link back to the mission tasks created for the FRAGO, thereby eliminating the need for duplicate data entry. SITREPs can be recalled using the map by way of clicking on mission tasks. The SIGACT widget allows guard staff to plot situational activity at a location on the map as well as enter appropriate information for it. SIGACT data is then shown on the COP and highlighted so that it can be acknowledged by NDNG JOC watch staff and other users in the organization. The Personnel widget provides the ability to view and query guard personnel by location, availability, and Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) to assist the JOC staff to respond to incidents.

In the past, the NCNG Environmental group managed and maintained this information on paper, which made it difficult to share this information and to produce summary reports. The new web-enabled tools now provide a way for guard staff to enter and update the information in a geodatabase, providing the ability to store and conduct spatial analysis with the data. The waste, NOVs, and spills are displayed on the map in the viewer, so any staff who has access to the viewer has the ability to see what is at the facility. Managers can use the tools with elevated access, providing them additional functionality, including the ability to produce summary reports with only a few clicks. The tools provide e-mail notification so managers know when new information has been added.

Contributors include: Novel-T, eHealth Nigeria, and World Health Organization - Nigeria. Nigeria is one of the last countries where polio is still endemic, and is considered by many to be the key country in achieving world polio eradication.  The polio immunization campaigns target every child under 5 years old over a 4 day period – a daunting task in countries with little infrastructure, limited access to internet resources, and a generally uneducated population.  The fundamental planning tool for a polio campaign is the microplan, which includes a map of the Ward (operational unit for public health activities) and a settlement list with target populations. The microplan is used to establish the number of vaccination teams required, and assigns each team the settlements to be covered each day.  In January of 2012, a project led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was initiated to replace existing hand-drawn microplan maps, which were incomplete and often inaccurate, with GIS-based maps.  The project focused on 9 high-risk states in the north where, at the time, all polio cases were occurring. Field teams were sent to collect settlement names and other points of interest (POIs), and satellite imagery was used to ensure all settled areas were included. The resulting maps were then inserted in the microplanning process to allow for more efficient team allocation and work assignments, and more importantly ensure that all settlements are included.  The GIS maps also serve as a base for the tracking of vaccination teams, which occurs in 40+ local Government Areas (LGAs) every campaign.  The tracks are uploaded each day of the campaign and are used to provide feedback to the local supervisors about team performance and geographic coverage.  In addition, the data is sent to a server at the National Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in Abuja and generates a web-based dashboard (http://vts.eocng.org/) where the tracking results can be viewed by all stakeholders. The GIS mapping and tracking effort has contributed to improved vaccination coverage, a reduction in chronically missed settlements, and a significant reduction in polio cases in 2013.  In addition, a cadre of young, talented Nigerians has been trained as GIS editors using ArcMap software, building the local capacity needed to expand the use of the GIS maps in other areas.","c":" Adam Thompson - eHealth, Evelyn Castle - eHealth, Stephane Vouillamoz - Novel-T, Patrick Briand - Novel-T, Kebba Touray - WHO-Nigeria","r":"Room 27 B","sid":"6258","oid":"17305"},{"dy":"Thursday","sd":"9:00 am","dur":"5 hours","t":"Showcase: 3D","eid":"15","d":"Our world is 3D.

This means that managing urban environments in 3D is an increasingly important undertaking. The ArcGIS for 3D Cities solution provides the data model, best practices, and a set of tools for creating, analyzing, and maintaining a 3D city using the ArcGIS platform. We will show how to synthesize a variety of 2D and 3D data sources, procedurally generate urban landscapes using Esri CityEngine, perform advanced 3D analytics, and share the results with others on the web. Industry-specific workflows, such as 3D zoning, will also be covered.","c":" Sean William Morrish - Esri, Thorsten Reitz - Esri, Craig McCabe - Esri","r":"Room 04","sid":"4878","oid":"14404"},{"dy":"Friday","sd":"9:00 am","dur":"an hour","t":"ArcGIS Online: An Introduction to the Living Atlas","eid":"4","d":"ArcGIS Online provides access to a diverse and growing set of content to enrich the ArcGIS user experience.

Demonstrations will include filtering events based on field values that are spatial and nonspatial, geofencing, calculating new fields, enriching events with fields from an external data source, removing fields, mapping events from one format to another, geotagging, detecting incidents, and detecting gaps in tracks.","c":" Adam Mollenkopf - Esri, Robert Sunderman Jr - Esri","r":"Room 07 A/B","sid":"4810","oid":"17157"},{"dy":"Friday","sd":"9:00 am","dur":"an hour","t":"Esri CityEngine: An Introduction","eid":"4","d":"Esri CityEngine is a powerful tool for generating 3D content from the 2D GIS data you already have, but the effectiveness of the tool relies very much on the quality and depth of useful information provided by your data. For example, building footprints with heights, roof form type, and exterior wall type will create more realistic, procedurally generated structures than footprints alone. This session will introduce the procedural CGA scripting language and discuss the kinds of features and attributes on which they will rely. It will also discuss how thematic representations of your data, rather than a pure photorealistic view, can be a powerful addition.","c":" Tom Kelly - Esri, Gert Van Maren - Esri","r":"Room 05 B","sid":"4993","oid":"17148"},{"dy":"Friday","sd":"9:00 am","dur":"an hour","t":"ArcGIS Online: ArcGIS for Open Data - An Introduction","eid":"4","d":"Government agencies and many organizations increasingly seek to make their information more discoverable and accessible to citizens.
