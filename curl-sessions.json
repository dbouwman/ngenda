He describes a framework for doing GeoDesign (design in geographic space) using six model types for assessing the geographic context,  for proposing changes and for evaluating the consequences of those changes. He then shows how this framework and these models can be used to understand, plan and manage a variety of landuse/management projects. He presents nine different strategies for proposing change and shows how they can be applied to different problem types at different scales, discussing the pros and cons of each in different situations. The seminar provides the participants with the equivalent of a graduate level seminar on GeoDesign.Additional Registration is required, fees apply.","conferenceID":"65","RowIdentity":"1171"},{"offeringID":"14460","sessionID":"6154","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/13/2014 3:00:00 PM","endDate":"7/13/2014 5:00:00 PM","duration":"2.00","startDay":"13","startHour":"15","startMinute":"0","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2014","dateID":"20140713","endDay":"13","endHour":"17","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2014","istSessionID":"1354","istScheduleID":"2171","accesscode":"3525","sessionTitle":"Agriculture Forum","eventTypeDescription":"Special Interest Group Meeting","eventTypeID":"5","room":"Room 25 C","floor":"3","xPoint":"-13042170.85","yPoint":"3856318.048","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"4","tracks":"5","supertracks":"15","sessionDescription":"Please join Esri’s Agriculture Forum on Sunday, July 13th 3:00pm-5:00pm concerning the application of GIS technology in the agriculture industry.

Complex procedures are available through Esri CityEngine, where you can write a procedural rule that can, for example, convert a building footprint into a seventeenth-century Parisian building, or convert a land-use polygon into the maximum structure that would still conform to the city's zoning laws. Procedural content is especially effective for iterative design-and-analyze geodesign workflows, where you can simply change a few feature attributes and quickly regenerate an updated design.

How can you convert one format into another? Do you even have to? Can you really bring that Excel spreadsheet of addresses into ArcMap without a lot of work? How can you visualize the addresses as points on the map?

Guard staff (both in the Joint Operations Center [JOC] and in the field) are enabled to enter information and track data on a map for Fragmentary Orders (FRAGO), Situational Reports (SITREP), and Significant Activities (SIGACT) through the viewer. The FRAGO widget allows staff to enter the five paragraph order information necessary for this report, place a FRAGO on the map at the appropriate location, and permit guard personnel who have access to see FRAGO data as icons on a map and recall the information tied to the FRAGOs. Furthermore, guard staff can tie mission tasks and associated details for multiple locations to the FRAGO and display these tasks on the map. The SITREP widget allows guard staff to enter information for the report and can link back to the mission tasks created for the FRAGO, thereby eliminating the need for duplicate data entry. SITREPs can be recalled using the map by way of clicking on mission tasks. The SIGACT widget allows guard staff to plot situational activity at a location on the map as well as enter appropriate information for it.

In the past, the NCNG Environmental group managed and maintained this information on paper, which made it difficult to share this information and to produce summary reports. The new web-enabled tools now provide a way for guard staff to enter and update the information in a geodatabase, providing the ability to store and conduct spatial analysis with the data. The waste, NOVs, and spills are displayed on the map in the viewer, so any staff who has access to the viewer has the ability to see what is at the facility. Managers can use the tools with elevated access, providing them additional functionality, including the ability to produce summary reports with only a few clicks. The tools provide e-mail notification so managers know when new information has been added. Visual cues on the map allow users to quickly see if items are reaching an important deadline.","conferenceID":"65","RowIdentity":"1413"},{"offeringID":"15580","sessionID":"6057","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/15/2014 1:00:00 PM","endDate":"7/15/2014 1:50:00 PM","duration":"0.83","startDay":"15","startHour":"13","startMinute":"0","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2014","dateID":"20140715","endDay":"15","endHour":"13","endMinute":"50","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2014","istSessionID":"1511","istScheduleID":"2302","accesscode":"3813","sessionTitle":"Airbus Constellation: Enjoy The Right Information At The Right Time","eventTypeDescription":"Special Presentation","eventTypeID":"7","room":"Room 16 A","floor":"","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"With a smart mix of Radar and Optical satellites, Airbus DS gives you what you need when you need it: wide coverage, fine detail, intensive monitoring, quick and reliable new collections, and an extensive archive.","conferenceID":"65","RowIdentity":"1292"},{"offeringID":"17314","sessionID":"6267","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/15/2014 1:00:00 PM","endDate":"7/15/2014 1:30:00 PM","duration":"0.50","startDay":"15","startHour":"13","startMinute":"0","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2014","dateID":"20140715","endDay":"15","endHour":"13","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2014","istSessionID":"1773","istScheduleID":"2639","accesscode":"4412","sessionTitle":"The Mpumalanga Biodiversity Sector Plan as a Land-use Decision Support Tool","eventTypeDescription":"Demo Theater Presentation","eventTypeID":"27","room":"Demo Theater - Environment Showcase - Conservation Exhibit Hall C","floor":"1","xPoint":"-13042467.52","yPoint":"3856466.405","contacts":" Mervyn LLötter - Mpumalanga Tourism &amp; Parks Agency","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"4","tracks":"144","supertracks":"15","sessionDescription":"The province of Mpumalanga, South Africa used a systematic conservation planning approach to develop the Mpumalanga Biodiversity Sector Plan, identifying the most efficient portfolio of planning units required to meet biodiversity targets.

Regression analysis also allows you to predict spatial outcomes for other places or time periods. Application and use of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) will be demonstrated. You will learn how to build a properly specified OLS model and interpret the results and diagnostics. As part of developing a well-specified model, we will use exploratory regression to more efficiently identify relationships within data.

This session will explore four powerful Spatial Statistics techniques designed to do just that: hot spot analysis, cluster and outlier analysis, grouping analysis, and the new similarity search. Through discussions and demonstrations, we will learn how these techniques can be used to identify significant patterns in our data. We will explore the different questions that each tool can answer, best practices for running the tools, and strategies for interpreting and sharing results.

This talk will center on the core challenge of understanding when interactivity is useful, how much interactivity is needed (for given tasks), and the kind of interactivity we can support.

Contributors include: Novel-T, eHealth Nigeria, and World Health Organization - Nigeria. Nigeria is one of the last countries where polio is still endemic, and is considered by many to be the key country in achieving world polio eradication.  The polio immunization campaigns target every child under 5 years old over a 4 day period – a daunting task in countries with little infrastructure, limited access to internet resources, and a generally uneducated population.  The fundamental planning tool for a polio campaign is the microplan, which includes a map of the Ward (operational unit for public health activities) and a settlement list with target populations. The microplan is used to establish the number of vaccination teams required, and assigns each team the settlements to be covered each day.  In January of 2012, a project led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was initiated to replace existing hand-drawn microplan maps, which were incomplete and often inaccurate, with GIS-based maps.  The project focused on 9 high-risk states in the north where, at the time, all polio cases were occurring. Field teams were sent to collect settlement names and other points of interest (POIs), and satellite imagery was used to ensure all settled areas were included. The resulting maps were then inserted in the microplanning process to allow for more efficient team allocation and work assignments, and more importantly ensure that all settlements are included.  The GIS maps also serve as a base for the tracking of vaccination teams, which occurs in 40+ local Government Areas (LGAs) every campaign.  The tracks are uploaded each day of the campaign and are used to provide feedback to the local supervisors about team performance and geographic coverage.  In addition, the data is sent to a server at the National Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in Abuja and generates a web-based dashboard (http://vts.eocng.org/) where the tracking results can be viewed by all stakeholders. The GIS mapping and tracking effort has contributed to improved vaccination coverage, a reduction in chronically missed settlements, and a significant reduction in polio cases in 2013.  In addition, a cadre of young, talented Nigerians has been trained as GIS editors using ArcMap software, building the local capacity needed to expand the use of the GIS maps in other areas.","conferenceID":"65","RowIdentity":"1517"},{"offeringID":"17279","sessionID":"5661","offeringCount":"3","levelID":"4","startDate":"7/17/2014 9:00:00 AM","endDate":"7/17/2014 1:30:00 PM","duration":"4.50","startDay":"17","startHour":"9","startMinute":"0","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2014","dateID":"20140717","endDay":"17","endHour":"13","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2014","istSessionID":"1288","istScheduleID":"1933","accesscode":"3221","sessionTitle":"Showcase: 3D","eventTypeDescription":"Onsite Services","eventTypeID":"15","room":"Exhibit Hall C","floor":"1","xPoint":"-13042439.04","yPoint":"3856456.451","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"Our world is 3D.

Over the last few years, with the increased adoption of Web 2.0 technologies, there is an increased interest in using open APIs to target interoperability challenges. In this context, this presentation will discuss the GeoServices REST API specification—an open specification made available by Esri. Multiple software solutions based on ArcGIS and non-Esri solutions will be used to make the case for using the Open GeoServices REST as a pragmatic, RESTful solution for meeting current interoperability challenges.","conferenceID":"65","RowIdentity":"638"},{"offeringID":"13116","sessionID":"5190","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"2","startDate":"7/17/2014 1:30:00 PM","endDate":"7/17/2014 2:45:00 PM","duration":"1.25","startDay":"17","startHour":"13","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"7","startYear":"2014","dateID":"20140717","endDay":"17","endHour":"14","endMinute":"45","endMonth":"7","endYear":"2014","istSessionID":"687","istScheduleID":"1381","accesscode":"2068","sessionTitle":"ArcGIS Runtime SDKs: The Road Ahead","eventTypeDescription":"Technical Workshop","eventTypeID":"4","room":"Room 07 A/B","floor":"3","xPoint":"-13042635.99","yPoint":"3856531.231","contacts":" Euan Cameron - Esri, Will Crick - Esri, David Cardella - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","parentsupertracks":"5","tracks":"647","supertracks":"35","sessionDescription":"The year 2014 is an exciting year for ArcGIS Runtime SDKs!

The main challenge for a holistic urban planning approach is to evolve, access and combine cross-disciplinary planning knowledge within a team of stakeholders with various personal and professional backgrounds (e.g. architects, urban and traffic planners, representatives from the municipality, and public community). Decision makers like urban planners from the municipalities, transport, health and energy experts are overwhelmed by the vast amount of information and modeling results provided by the individual experts. Often the planning decisions were evolved consecutive but determining each other. In the planning process currently missing are (a) integrated access to the planning knowledge of specialists, (b) techniques or modes of visualization for communicating expert insights such as costs and benefits of proposed options to stakeholders in a simplified, condensed form, and (c) techniques to process stakeholder feedback in a participatory way back into systems for experts. These missing links need to be closed in order to arrive at process driven benchmarking and planning within the realm of densification processes, climate change and upcoming scarcity of resources.Therefore, new interactive decision support tools are needed to support the cross-sectoral urban planning. These interactive tools should feature innovative 3D web-based technologies and touch-device-based assessment of urban climate, densification, construction materials or associated legal regulations. With the interactive visual feedback on the design solutions a cross-sectoral understanding will be supported and a consensus on the planning decisions will be achieved in the early planning stages.","sessionAssetSequenceNumber":"1","sessionAssetAuthor":"Jan  Halatsch","sessionAssetAuthorBio":"Jan Halatsch is engaged as CTO of SmarterBetterCities AG.

Waste generation increases with population expansion and economic development. Rapid industrialization and population explosion in India has led to the migration of people from villages to cities, which generate thousands of tons of solid waste daily. Improperly managed solid waste poses a risk to human health and the environment. The solid waste amount is expected to increase significantly in the near future as the country strives to attain an industrialized nation status by the year 2020 (Sharma and Shah, 2005; CPCB, 2004; Shekdar et al 1992). Poor collection and inadequate transportation are responsible for the accumulation of solid waste at every nook and corner. The management of solid waste is going through a critical phase, due to the unavailability of suitable facilities to treat and dispose of the larger amount of solid waste generated daily in cities. Uncontrolled dumping and improper waste handling causes a variety of problems, including contaminating water, attracting insects and rodents, and increasing flooding due to blocked drainage canals or gullies. Improper waste management also increases greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Most of our cities and municipalities in third world countries like India are struggling with improper disposal of waste. Hence, it is significant to study waste disposal practice in Malerkotla city of Sangrur district in Punjab and suggest feasible solid waste management strategies.The aims of the present study are to the highlight the present locations of solid waste disposal site in Malerkotla city which are creating health and environmental hazards. Based on fieldwork proper waste management practices are also suggested for Malerkotla city.The inferences and conclusions of the study were drawn on the basis of analysis of primary data and secondary data. The primary data related to major solid waste dumping site in the Malerkotla city was collected through intensive field work during March 2013. Secondary data available in the form of Census data, satellite imagery, articles, papers, books etc was also used in the study. The data collected from field survey has been processed in the GIS environment and required map layers have been generated for analysis purposes. Satellite imagery, administrative boundary maps etc were the input data. A field survey was carried to verify the dumping site in city.The maps were scanned and on screen digitization was carried in ESRI Arc GIS Version (9.3).

The services under this contract may be performed in any of the fifty United States or its territories, for government agencies under contract ##HSHQDC-13-D-RS001.The primary requirement of these contracts is to acquire fresh airborne imagery or LiDAR and upload onto FEMA’s geospatial portal fully GIS useable E/O imagery or LiDAR within 48 hours from receipt of Notice to Proceed (NTP).  In June of 2013 all four contractors received an initial tasking, an ‘emergency response exercise’ to test their capabilities to meet or exceed the 48 hour delivery requirement.After the ‘exercise’ in follow on meetings with  FEMA and DHS, Geospatial Management Office (GMO) within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) a need was identified to provide very rapid IA & PA damage assessments using commercial airborne imagery. The goal was identified as providing the IA & PA damage assessment as soon as possible, even in advance of the ortho corrected imagery if possible.Case Study:Granbury, Texas.  May 16, 2013  EF-4 TornadoAero-Metric collected 4-band E/O imagery using a large format DMC sensor of the impacted area.  Imagery was ortho corrected and image tiles created referenced to the US National Grid within 24 hours after acquisition, available on Areo-Metric GeoAPP cloud based service.Using the NIR band an IA (individual assistance) damage assessment was performed using FEMA’s protocol identifying four (4) levels of damage.  The rapid IA was completed in less than 4 hours.Conclusion:The results of the Granbury, TX case study on rapid damage assessment clearly demonstrated that rapid IA or PA damage assessments can be performed in less than 24 hours from acquisition of airborne commercial imagery and can be fully GIS useable via a GeoAPP or Geospatial portal in advance of the delivery of the ortho corrected image tiles.Next Step(s):Further study is planned to test tools, techniques and processes for automation of the IA & PA damage assessment task.  Of particular interest is the potential of utilizing algorithms developed for pattern recognition applications in the biometrics field for identification of debris, roof damage and other damage assessment applications.","sessionAssetSequenceNumber":"2","sessionAssetAuthor":"Scott Perkins","sessionAssetAuthorBio":"Scott is a certified GIS Professional (GISP) with over 30 years’ experience in the geospatial business including owning and operating a small business, as an Officer & Shareholder in an ENR Top 200 A&E firm, as President of T-Kartor USA an International geospatial firm.

During this time 44% of supported districts reported on both HTC and PMTCT while only 36% reported on ART. Another 33% and 27% of districts reported on time for PMTCT/HTC and ART datasets respectively. Description of the intervention:In July 2012, results from the analysis were presented using GIS maps during a joint performance review meeting with District Health Information Officers (DHRIOs). Graduated coloured maps were used to display comparisons of reporting rates and timeliness across districts for HTC, ART and PMTCT. The maps illustrated district performance ranking making it easy for each DHRIO to visually gauge their performance against the rest. The meeting discussed individual district reporting rates, and identified contributing factors to the performance. All DHRIOs agreed to meet a minimum reporting rate of 50% by September 2012 and 95% by December 2012. A performance recognition mechanism was initiated to reward districts with improved performance. Lessons learned:Visual GIS maps presented during the performance meeting heightened DHRIOs’ interest and created internal competition. By the end of September 2012, reporting rates for HTC, PMTCT and ART had increased to 84%, 81%, and 78% respectively. Timeliness for HTC, PMTCT, and ART improved to 81%, 78% and 73% respectively.

Waste generation increases with population expansion and economic development. Rapid industrialization and population explosion in India has led to the migration of people from villages to cities, which generate thousands of tons of solid waste daily. Improperly managed solid waste poses a risk to human health and the environment. The solid waste amount is expected to increase significantly in the near future as the country strives to attain an industrialized nation status by the year 2020 (Sharma and Shah, 2005; CPCB, 2004; Shekdar et al 1992). Poor collection and inadequate transportation are responsible for the accumulation of solid waste at every nook and corner. The management of solid waste is going through a critical phase, due to the unavailability of suitable facilities to treat and dispose of the larger amount of solid waste generated daily in cities. Uncontrolled dumping and improper waste handling causes a variety of problems, including contaminating water, attracting insects and rodents, and increasing flooding due to blocked drainage canals or gullies. Improper waste management also increases greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Most of our cities and municipalities in third world countries like India are struggling with improper disposal of waste. Hence, it is significant to study waste disposal practice in Malerkotla city of Sangrur district in Punjab and suggest feasible solid waste management strategies.The aims of the present study are to the highlight the present locations of solid waste disposal site in Malerkotla city which are creating health and environmental hazards. Based on fieldwork proper waste management practices are also suggested for Malerkotla city.The inferences and conclusions of the study were drawn on the basis of analysis of primary data and secondary data. The primary data related to major solid waste dumping site in the Malerkotla city was collected through intensive field work during March 2013. Secondary data available in the form of Census data, satellite imagery, articles, papers, books etc was also used in the study. The data collected from field survey has been processed in the GIS environment and required map layers have been generated for analysis purposes. Satellite imagery, administrative boundary maps etc were the input data. A field survey was carried to verify the dumping site in city.The maps were scanned and on screen digitization was carried in ESRI Arc GIS Version (9.3).

The main challenge for a holistic urban planning approach is to evolve, access and combine cross-disciplinary planning knowledge within a team of stakeholders with various personal and professional backgrounds (e.g. architects, urban and traffic planners, representatives from the municipality, and public community). Decision makers like urban planners from the municipalities, transport, health and energy experts are overwhelmed by the vast amount of information and modeling results provided by the individual experts. Often the planning decisions were evolved consecutive but determining each other. In the planning process currently missing are (a) integrated access to the planning knowledge of specialists, (b) techniques or modes of visualization for communicating expert insights such as costs and benefits of proposed options to stakeholders in a simplified, condensed form, and (c) techniques to process stakeholder feedback in a participatory way back into systems for experts. These missing links need to be closed in order to arrive at process driven benchmarking and planning within the realm of densification processes, climate change and upcoming scarcity of resources.Therefore, new interactive decision support tools are needed to support the cross-sectoral urban planning. These interactive tools should feature innovative 3D web-based technologies and touch-device-based assessment of urban climate, densification, construction materials or associated legal regulations.
